            <h2>Fancy founder returns with $1,000-per-month luxury shopping startup, Long Story Short</h2>
            <p>A new luxury goods e-commerce startup dubbed Long Story Short has a provocative concept: 
                it’s $1,000 per month to join for the privilege of shopping its curated collection. 
                Shocking as that sounds, founder Joseph Einhorn believes he understands this sliver of the e-commerce market, and why many
                 online luxury ventures to date have failed to work. The founder, known best for his 2010s e-commerce site The Fancy,
                  an upscale shoppable Pinterest rival, says high-net-worth individuals demand more in terms of privacy and security 
                  from their online experience — something that shopping a luxury marketplace often does not provide.</p>
